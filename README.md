This is a Next 13 + Sanity starter repo.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Node
- Sanity CLI: https://www.sanity.io/docs/cli?slug=getting-started-with-sanity-cli

## Getting Started

1. Clone starter project and rename it "some-project-name" and remove hidden folder .git
2. Create a new totally separate Sanity project via the cli by running `sanity init`
3. Delete the local Sanity project that was just created, all the sanity files you need are already in your "some-project-name" project
4. Go to [sanity.io](http://sanity.io/) and copy the newly created `projectId` into the env file of your "some-project-name"
5. Start development on your new project

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

After that the starter will be available on http://localhost:3000,
to reach the Sanity admin go to http://localhost:3000/admin and try to login with the sanity account (you will need an invtie to a Sanity project).

All test env variables are present in the env.local.example
